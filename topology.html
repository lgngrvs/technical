                <h2>Results from skimming a topology textbook</h2>
<p>Experiment: Skimming a textbook, aiming for speed and definition. I don't care about doing practice problems. I want to eat the intuitions and the models and the formal ideas.</p>
<p><em>I didn't actually do a very good job skimming, I just kind of messed around for maybe a couple hours — max two or something like that. It's fine, though — it was still fun and valuable.</em></p>
<p>A <strong>topology</strong> for a set $X$ is a set $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ such that 
1. the whole set $X$ and the empty set both belong to $\tau$
2. any union of the sets in $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$
3. any intersection of the sets in $\tau$ is in $\tau$</p>
<p>We call it a <strong>topological space</strong> if we hold the pair together $(X, \tau)$. The members of $\tau$ are <strong>open sets</strong>.</p>
<p>A subset is <strong>closed</strong> in the topology $(X, \tau)$ if $X \setminus S$ is open. The textbook says that this notation is derived from open and closed intervals; a subset is open if it's fully contained in the set, and closed if the a set of $X$ <em>except</em> it is in the set. A subset is <strong>clopen</strong> if it's both open and closed. (e.g. for $(X, \tau)$, $X$ and $\emptyset$ will always be clopen; they are complements)</p>
<p><em>Seems like a strange definition and doesn't intuitively connect to geometry.</em></p>
<p>Interesting: if you define $\tau_4$ as the set containing $\mathbb{N}$, $\emptyset$, and all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, $\tau_4$ is <em>not</em> a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ because it doesn't contain all the <em>infinite</em> subsets of $\mathbb{N}$.</p>
<p>We call it a <strong>discrete topology</strong> if $\tau$ is the collection of <em>all subsets</em> of $X$.</p>
<p>We call it an <strong>indiscrete topology</strong> if $\tau$ is just ${X, \emptyset}$
- Aye, it's still a topology — the only intersections and unions you can define are the set with the empty set.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on Sets and such:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>proper subset</em> is one that is a subset of $X$ but is not $X$. ($A | A \subseteq X$ → $A \subset X$)</li>
</ul>
<p>skipping <em>finite-closed topology</em> and <em>inverse, inverse mapping</em></p>
<p>The <strong>euclidean topology</strong> on the real numbers is pretty important, apparently. </p>
<p>We call $S$ open in the <strong>euclidean topology</strong> on $\mathbb{R}$ if, for each member $x$ of $S$, there exists an interval $(a,b)$ (where $a&lt;B$) such that $x \in (a,b) \subseteq S$. For each member of a given subset, there's an interval which constitutes a subset of $S$ that contains it.</p>
<p><em>I don't really get this right now. I can come back to it. The proof seems important.</em></p>
<p>A collection $\mathcal{B}$ of open subsets of $X$ is the <strong>basis</strong> for the topological space $(X, \tau)$ if every open set is a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is analogous to the idea of basis vectors in linear algebra, where each vector can be expressed as a combination of basis vectors; here each open set in $\tau$ can be expressed as a combination of the basis sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>$\mathcal{B}$ must have the following properties: </p>
<ul>
<li>$X = \bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{B}} B$ </li>
<li>For any $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$, $B_1 \cap B_2$ can be created by a union of members of $\mathcal{B}$</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of bases</p>
<ul>
<li>$\mathcal{B} = {(a,b): a,b \in \mathbb{R}, a &lt; b}$. $\mathcal{B} is a basis for the euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$. (Trivially, because that's how you define the euclidean topology; this doesn't really seem interesting.)</li>
<li>For some discrete space $(X, \tau)$, let's define $\mathcal{B}$ as the family of all singleton subsets of $X$, i.e. $\mathcal{B} = {{x}: x \in X}$. $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\tau$. (this was proved earlier)</li>
<li>Let $X = {a,b,c,d,e,f}$, and $$\tau_1 = {X, \emptyset, {a}, {c,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d,e,f}}.$$ then $\mathcal{B} = {{a}, {c,d}, {b,c,d,e,f}}$ is a basis for $\tau_1$. $\tau_1$ is also a basis for $\tau_1$. </li>
</ul>
<p>There can be multiple bases for the same topology. If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, then a superset of $\mathcal{B}$ in $\tau$ will be a basis as well.</p>

<p>Now this starts to get us into geometry. You can generalize this to higher dimensions relatively easily. </p>
<p>I don't understand this definition unfortunately. Where do the bounds on $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ come from?</p>
<p>Anyway, you use limit points to define density. Limit points seem interesting.</p>
<p>Then you get into neighborhoods — $N$ is a neighborhood of a point $p \in N$ if there's an open set $U$ such that $p \in U \subseteq N$. (doesn't make sense to me right now but that's fine; I just want to see where this textbook is going).</p>
<p>Interesting vocabulary: topo space is <strong>connected</strong> if the only clopen subsets of $X$ are $X$ and $\emptyset$.</p>
<p>Homeomorphism (p 96); any topological space homeomorphic to a connected space is connected. Function is continuous [epsilon-delta definition] → need to come up with different definitions that work for this</p>
<ul>
<li>a continuous mapping from one topological space onto another is continuous mapping if for each open set $U$ in the topological space on $Y$, there is an inverse image available in the space on $X$. </li>
</ul>
<p>Then you reconstruct the intermediate value theorem. A fixed point is a point such that after a continuous mapping of something onto itself the point maps onto itself. Some stuff about metric spaces. Redefinition of monotonic sequences. Contraction mappings. Mean value theorem. Okay, I ran out of steam around chapter 7.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: space filling curves! :D Look into works by people named Bernoulli, the name keeps coming up</p>
