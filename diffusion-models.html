                <h1>How diffusion models work</h1>
<p>The fun part is that I actually don't <em>know</em> how diffusion models work, so I'm writing this post as I figure it out.</p>
<p>Something something convolutional neural networks. I mean, I get that the intuition is that you train a model to denoise until it can denoise from pure gaussian noise to a "novel" image, but I don't actually understand why that works, or how you can get custon outputs. </p>
<p>Intuitiely, for a single "kind" of image, you could train a diffusion model on a bunch of similar images, and it would learn to produce images similar to those which it was trained on -- it could pick up those patterns. This makes sense intuitively. What I don't get is how you can get the model to actually produce the things you <em>want</em> from it.</p>
