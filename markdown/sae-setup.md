Posted by Logan Graves on Aug 8, 2024

So, you saw the Anthropic [Golden Gate Bridge Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude) post and you want to try out their techniques.

This post is a little guide on how to get a minimal, high-abstraction experimental setup working so you can play around with very similar techniques.

The first thing we need to do is get our inference running. Modal provides free
