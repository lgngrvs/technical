## The Basics

**Hi! I'm Logan.** 

I want to learn everything in the world. I want to contain multitudes.

I needed a second site because I was spending too much time tweaking the aesthetics on my main blog, and not enough time doing things that really mattered to me. This subdomain is just for notes.

Here you'll find the products of exploration into things I think might be interesting, not systematic self-teaching by any means. I do my best to learn things correctly, but since these are just public notes, I can't guarantee accuracy. Please [reach out](https://logangraves.com/about) if you find errors :)
